### Overview

https://github.com/LiveDuo/communities/raw/master/.notes/assets/landing/hero.png

"Communities" is a tool that creates online communities owned by the creators. They can invite their followers, fans or readers to their community to discuss, share ideas and interact. Users can login with their Ethereum, Solana or IC account using the standard browser extensions. Creators today build and interact with their fan relying on third-party platforms. We believe they should truly own the space they created, literally, in their wallet.

### Decentralization

This works well with the canister-model on the Internet computer. Communities ownership is transferred to creators right after the new canister is created and creators can in turned manage this communities as canister controllers. Moreover, the deployed canisters follow the ICRC-7 standard that allows creators to see these canisters as NFTs in their wallets and top up or transfer them to another user if needed. Canister upgrades are opt-in and can be done through the admin panel in the canister frontend only by the owner of that community.

That includes details about the deployment & upgrade process, our database design, Ethereum/Solana logins, custom domains and more.

### Go-To-Market

We are planning the following:
- Launch the project on ProductHunt
- Attract developers through the work we are doing on Github
- Launch on different subreddits (some crypto and some not)
- Share our work on our personal twitter accounts

### Status and Plans

The project is currently in a working **beta** stage. This means that all core functionality of the project is expected to work but the current version is not extensively tested or audited.

We welcome feedback on both the user experience and technical design of the project. Feel free to get in touch in the [Github](https://github.com/LiveDuo/communities/issues), on [Twitter](twitter.com/andreas_tzionis) or here in the forum.

At this point we want to assess how different users see this idea that based on a different architecture and we either decentralize the parent canister or maintain it as an open source project.
