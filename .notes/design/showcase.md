### Overview

https://github.com/LiveDuo/communities/raw/master/.notes/assets/landing/hero.png

Communities.ooo is a tool that allows creators to create online communities that they fully own. Creators can invite their followers, fans or readers to their community to discuss, share ideas and interact. Users can login with their Ethereum, Solana or IC account using the standard browser extensions.

### Decentralization

The canister-model of the Internet computer fits the design described above. New communities are deployed as new canisters and community ownership is transferred to creators right after the new canister is created by assigning the creator as the canister controller. Moreover, the deployed canisters follow the ICRC-7 standard that allows creators to see these canisters as NFTs in their wallets and transfer to a different user or account if needed. Opt-in community upgrades are canister upgrades where the community canister requests the upgrade data from the parent canister and then it upgrade itself by calling the management canister.

### How it works

To learn more about the technical details of this project check the [relevant section on Github](https://github.com/LiveDuo/communities?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works). That includes details about the deployment & upgrade process, our database design, Ethereum/Solana logins, custom domains and more.

### Go-To-Market

We are planning the following:
- Launch the project on ProductHunt
- Attract developers through the work we are doing on Github
- Launch on different subreddits (some crypto and some not)
- Share our work on our personal twitter accounts

### Status and Plans

The project is currently in a working **beta** stage. This means that all core functionality of the project is expected to work but the current version is not extensively tested or audited.

We welcome feedback on both the user experience and technical design of the project. Feel free to get in touch in the [Github](https://github.com/LiveDuo/communities/issues), on [Twitter](twitter.com/andreas_tzionis) or here in the forum.
